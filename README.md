# aircrack_ng_all_8digit_numbers_wordlist_generator.py
# README

This script generates a wordlist file containing all possible 8-digit numbers (00000000 to 99999999) and uses it to test against a capture file with aircrack-ng. The wordlist file is then deleted.

**Requirements:**

Python 3.x
aircrack-ng installed on your system
sudo privileges to run aircrack-ng
a capture file (e.g. handshake_file.cap) in the same directory as the script

**Usage:**

1. Place the script in the same directory as the capture file.
2. Run the script with Python (e.g. `python (link unavailable)`).
3. The script will generate the wordlist file, run aircrack-ng, and then delete the wordlist file.

**Note:**

* The wordlist file will be approximately 800MB in size.
* This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used for illegal activities.
